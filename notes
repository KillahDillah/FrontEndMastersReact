Parcel vs webpack - using Parcel (packager) because it's "hands-off", no need for config. Webpack is more difficult to setup but can do more "crazy" things, with power comes complexity

"dev": "parcel src/index.html" inside package.json serves to localhost

Because we are using Parcel - we can use JSX
JSX translates HTML into Javascript that React can use
